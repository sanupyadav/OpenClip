"""The clip floor must survive a model that ignores it.

`min_clips` lived only in the detail prompt, so a run that came back with
half the requested clips shipped half the clips: the measured 9:10 source
asked for 6-12 and delivered 3-4. The windows the detail pass skipped get
one more call before the job settles for less.
